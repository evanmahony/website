        <h2>Self Hosted Website Guide</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            This article is a guide to setting up your own self hosted website. A self hosted website gives you full control of your setup and is extremely extensible.
            While it requires a bit more of a time investment up front and may be more expensive, it is a great learning experience and offers much more power than prebuilt solutions. 
            During this guide I'll show you how to get and set up your domain name, a virtual private server, how we display our website and finally we'll work on the actual webstite with some basic HTML and CSS.
            I'm not a web developer so this is only my experience. This guide is inspired by Luke Smith and his series. I'll include some additional resources that I found helpful below.
        </p>
        <p>I'm still learning this so if you have anything I could change please get in touch. Okay let's get into this!</p>
        <h3>Domain Name</h3>

            I choose to use Epik as my DNS server
