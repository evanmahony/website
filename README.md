# My Website

A git repository to keep track of changes to my website [evanmahony.xyz](evanmahony.xyz).
Website is intended to be a simple page writen with HTML and CSS with some basic details and a few articles.

CSS colour scheme is inspired by [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) by Morhetz.
