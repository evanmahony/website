		<h1>Spar Employees Trade Union - Lissarda (SETUL)</h1>
		<p>SETUL is an Ultimate Frisbee club based out of Lissarda. We are a young club that draws from underage and college players from Cork and Dublin. We were founded in 2019 by Evan and Niall Mahony and Danny Datson. Together we are co-founders and co-captains. We represent our favourite place in the parish!</p>

		<h2>Competitions</h2>
		<p>We've had success at various club tournaments in Ireland with plans to keep playing and competing in Ireland and further afield.</p>

		<h3>2019 Junior All Irelands</h3>
		<p>Our first competition as a club was a great success as we won an All Ireland with a clean sweep of victories. On the 31st of August we made our way from Cork and Dublin, to Maguires Pitches in University of Limerick. Our under 21s roster battled the wind, rain and cramps to emerge victorious in our maiden tournament</p>
