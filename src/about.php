		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>If you would like to find out anything else about me please contact me.</p>
		<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>I am in third year of Bachelor of Actuarial and Financial Studies (BAFS) in University College Dublin where I received an entrance scholarship. I completed my Leaving Certificate in 2018 in Presenntation Brothers College Cork.</p>

		<h3>Areas of Interest</h3>
		<p>I found my favourite aspect of college study to be programming. In college we have learned Python, R, Stata, VBA and Excel. Meanwhile I have learned programming languages such as Matlab/Octave and used Python packages such as Numpy, Pandas and SCIKIT learn. I have an interest in Machine Learning.</p>
		<p>Maths is also an area I enjoy having taken modules in Optimisation, Search Engines, pricing and statistics.</p>

		<h2>Work Experience</h2>
		<p>I have just finished my third summer of work in the Bons Secours Hospital in Cork City. This year I worked as a CT porter compared to pervious years where I worked in the Accounts and Billing department. As part of my job I learned Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which I found to be one of the more interesting aspects. Working as a has porter thought me a lot but nothing about Excel! I have worked a variety of different summer jobs and also completed a weeks work experience with New Ireland Assurance.</p> 

		<h2>Ultimate Frisbee</h2>
		<p>I've been playing Ultimate Frisbee since 2015. I am a co-founder and co-captain of the 2019 Junior All-Ireland winning <a href='setul.html'>SETU-Lissarda</a>. I play club frisbee with Rebel Ultimate in Cork and intervarsity frisbee with UCD. I have been club treasurer and I am currently a social secretary for the club.</p>
